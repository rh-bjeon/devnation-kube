.VSCode: Open Terminal in Editor
****
If you're doing this tutorial from within VSCode you may be running out of space to put your terminals at this point!  If you have a recent release of VSCode, you might consider opening a new terminal in the editor pane by using kbd:[CTRL+SHIFT+p] (or kbd:[CMD+SHIFT+p] on Mac OSX) to run the `Terminal: Create Terminal in Editor Area` command
